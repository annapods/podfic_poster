Old version -> only debug for now, will rework when assimilated into the new version

- Separate logic and UI
- All handlers as singletons
- Logging
- Documentation

Known issues:
- why three times the sticker credits?
- can't find project ID when first trying to post
- trying to merge the translation files after recomputing the translation template from the code creates additional .po~ files
- can't add collections, gifting to someone, etc
- if reuploading same file (same name) to GDrive, will create duplicates
- ao3 download fails more often than not

Nice to have:
- cover art alt text for each cover
- thanks to cover artist in thanks section
- automatize install
