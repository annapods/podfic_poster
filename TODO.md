Old version -> only debug for now, will rework when assimilated into the new version

- Separate logic and UI
- All handlers as singletons
- Logging
- Documentation

Known issues:
- why three times the sticker credits?
- can't find project ID when first trying to post
- trying to merge the translation files after recomputing the translation template from the code creates additional .po~ files.
