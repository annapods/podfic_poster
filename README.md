# Podfic poster

I'm lazy so I decided to automatize my podfic posting process. That's it.

## Licence

Mostly for me, but if it can be useful feel free to reuse any parts of it? MIT license I guess? I'll love you forever if you help me improve it, it's a mess.

## Documentation

Cf INSTALLME.md, USAGE.md, TRANSLATEME.md, and the github issues.
